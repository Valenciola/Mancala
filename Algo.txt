~Things to Do~

Game
- Create an array for the board
- Create two variables for the banks
- Create a randomized turn system and a variable to note the turn
- Figure out how I'm going to make anything that LOOKS like a mancala board in the terminal

Mechanisms
- Create a function that will iterate through the stones in each cell
- Create an initialization function to empty each bank and fill each cell with four stones
- SirSafety should check if any one side is empty and decide to end the game if that's true
- Function to compare totals in the banks and decide a winner
- Make sure the stone skips the bank that doesn't belong to the player (maybe part of the iteration function)

CPU
- A variable to track difficulty level
- A function to decide the best move and log it in another variable (should have a value between 1 and 6, to represent the cells)
- A variable to decide whether to play the best move or a random move
- A function to decide the random move
- A function to play moves

Failsafes
- Make sure the program aborts if there are less than 48 stones
- Makes sure the program doesn't run any illegal moves (a.k.a DON'T EVEN TRY IT)

Else
- Compute data on separate lines before making the terminal picture
- Do math when testing the CPU; should choose the move that gives the most stones

Extra (for the future?)
- Give extra options for the starting number of stones
- Allow players to enter names
- Give an accuracy report for best moves played? (100% for best, 50% for second best, 0% for all others?)
- Log wins and losses
